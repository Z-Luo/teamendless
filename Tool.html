    <h1>Tool</h1>

    
    <p> We are working on a report about making VR games and discussing and sharing ideas. And make detailed information into a website. We built a group <a href="https://github.com/s839954/teamendless">Git repository</a> to rely on GitHub for this project (link: https://github.com/s839954/teamendless), and then invited each member's personal GitHub and granted editing and uploading permissions. During the production process, each member published their own ideas, shared their personal views, and finally determined that the name of the game was "End", and completed the assigned task and uploaded it to the git repository, which contains the following parts: team information , Tools, project descriptions, skills and jobs, feedback, group reflection. Regarding website production, in addition to the usual school Lecture, our group also learns about HTML and CSS on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> (https://www.w3schools.com/) and applies it to our website.</p>
    <p> But since we did n’t know that we had to upload it from the beginning to show the progress of our work, the Git repository reflected that our work all lasted for a while and was close to the submission time, but in fact we have been working on our project step by step . At first, we always let one person perform the entire file upload, but later we changed it.</p>
