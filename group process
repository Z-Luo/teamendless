The last test was the first teamwork of our team. There were many problems manifested, there was not enough communication, and it was not clear what everyone was good at. The random assignment of tasks led to the last test being unsuccessful and we did not use Microsoft Team to communicate, we have used Messenger to communicate but obviously the communication is not enough, and did not seriously check the test requirements, did not use GitHub, did not establish our group's Git repository, in general we did not take the last test seriously, nor Do your best to complete it. For this test, we made changes, strengthened the communication between the team members, knew each other, shared their ideas with each other, and established our group's Git repository, carefully designed the website to be improved with more professional HTML and CSS Website design. To plan in detail to complete the project idea, a goal will be set at each stage. This will not be an individual task, but each member of the group will participate. This will allow everyone to have a detailed and profound understanding of the project.
