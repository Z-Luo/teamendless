<p>Group Reflection:
Our team has learned the lessons of ass2 and has a better performance. Everyone is more active for completing the work we have set, and the log record of github has become a lot more. There is room for improvement. We could have communicated more and exchanged ideas more. One thing I was surprised that some team members were still working after twelve in the evening. When I got up the next day, the work was uploaded to git. What I learned from the group is that only when everyone works together and it is easier for us to complete the task more efficiently and effectively.

This is the second teamwork of our group. Compared with the last time, there will be obvious progress. We work more like a whole, thinking that it is the work of the team. We will help each other and discuss solutions. These cooperation sections highlight the importance of communication. Compared to the previous test, we did better in this test. As a whole, we should pay attention to everyone's progress and condition, not just complete our work. I think we have done a good job in team assignment. However, there are still many areas for improvement, mainly to maintain a positive learning attitude. What surprised our team is that the expertise and resources required to make VR games are not easy to complete, which requires a lot of effort . In this cooperation, each of us should have learned a lot, which will help a lot in the future.

<h2>Trung Hieu Dang</h2>
<p>in this assignment, there are still many thing that i should improve for the future in group working although i think i did better than the previous assignment. I’m able to work with other with more confident but sometime when i didn’t fully understand the requirement i wasn’t discuss with other but working alone because i want to be responsible for the part that i’m assigned to, that the reason we can’t finish soon and also what i should change for the better group work. I also found the note taking is useful when i find and read some article on the internet, it help me ensure that i right information for the assignment but of course my note taking is still not really good because my handwriting is bad and not all the information i write is necessary. Maybe next time i should take note using word or other writing application.</p>

<h2>Rithvik Abothu</h2>
<p>In our group, we were all very fair on each other, there were no arguments, and everything was conducted smoothly and professionally. All members of the group had starting comminating and responding much more frequently which was a very big improvement since assignment two. The frequent reminders from group members who would mention me in the Teams group chat or private message me was very helpful as they were always supportive and wanted to know how I was doing, where I was up to and if I needed any assistance. Some things that could be improved was maybe a few more meetings as we did the bare minimum for video and audio meetings. Something that was surprising is that working as a group and planning a real project is a lot of fun seeing all the different roles that people play and how it all comes together to form the final product, it was fun to see and surprising to experience. One thing I have learnt about groups is that By working with the same people multiple times, you get to know their strengths and weaknesses, you create experiences to reflect on, and you build unsaid habits and rules that help you understand each other better. GitHub was a good tool to work with but it was a bit difficult to work with and get started but it reflects the team’s work well and after learning how to use it it turned out to be a valuable tool that I might use in my future.</p>
