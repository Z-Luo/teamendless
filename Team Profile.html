I got my first smartphone in the first year of highschool and before that my only play-things is the TV and my brother's computer so i don't get to do much on the computer.
That why i was so excited to see what game i can play on that phone. The first few game had very simple graphic, simple play style but gradually i found more game such as Asylum, beholder, Asphalt 8,... with much more complex graphic and play style, it's almost like they create the whole new world inside a small phone.
The application in the phone is also amazing, so convenient that i wanted to know how they created. </li>
IT experience: So i'm began to learn more and more familial with many terms like android, ios, PC, root,... and even learned a bit of C++ programing language. Time past by, i had to choose what field to study in university and by then i know what to choose.<br>

<td>Career plans: <br>
My ideal job was a web designer. After this study and research, I still think that web designers are more suitable for me, because the VR game field is too demanding. In comparison, web designers are not required as much as VR game designer. They also have in common, that is, they all need to test, and learn the habits of users to better develop products.

<td>Career plans: <br>
my ideal job before i start this course is software developer, but after doing this assignment, I think I’m more interested in game developer. I want to try to create a game with a group like this again in the future. Also, i’m aiming for the mobile game market in particular because there is a potential in the device. I would still need to complete this course to continue on my career plan and I also realise that there is a mobile application development in the course so hope it might be a good start.

Sihan Zhang（UI/UX Designer）：Since we are going to design games, it made me more interested in design. I changed my ideal job from Mobile App Developer to UI / UX Designer. Of course, this is still inseparable from information technology and I want to be a good design. Teacher, in addition to excellent design ideas, rich information technology-related knowledge, and communication between customers are also very important. At present, I need to successfully complete the it course, and then accumulate experience through work, have good strength to complete the ideal job.

<h2>Group Process</h2>
<p>The last test was the first teamwork of our team. There were many problems manifested, there was not enough communication, and it was not clear what everyone was good at. The random assignment of tasks led to the last test 	being unsuccessful and we did not use Microsoft Team to communicate, we have used Messenger to communicate but obviously the communication is not enough, and did not seriously check the test requirements, did not use GitHub, did not establish our group's Git repository, in general we did not take the last test seriously, nor Do your best to complete it. For this test, we made changes, strengthened the communication between the team members, knew each other, shared their ideas with each other, and established our group's Git repository, carefully designed the website to be improved with more professional HTML and CSS Website design. To plan in detail to complete the project idea, a goal will be set at each stage. This will not be an individual task, but each member of the group will participate. This will allow everyone to have a detailed and profound understanding of the project.</p>
