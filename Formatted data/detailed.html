<h2>Aims</h2>
<p>First of all, if you want to complete a complete design, there are still many problems with high-quality immersive VR games. Solving these problems is our main purpose.
VR game picture quality, motion control experience
In VR games, VR technology is a very important part. The immersive experience of VR games relies on the advancement of technology. At present, many VR games have certain technical problems. In addition to well-known problems such as vertigo and delay, the system also includes coarse images. The picture freezes, bugs or the picture delays constantly. Motion control is also an important part of VR games. Good motion control can make players more comfortable and easily control the game, and the adverse effects of the game on the body, such as reducing dizziness.
 <br>
Conception and design of VR games
Technology is undoubtedly the key factor for the success of VR games, but compared to VR technology, the game's reasonable conception and design are the core and essence of the game, and the fun of players. Imagine that those stories are creepy, boring and poorly designed games can easily be boring. Therefore, good game conception and design are very important.

<br>
Cooperation between the operation of VR games and VR hardware
Some game operations are not coordinated with the configuration of VR hardware devices, resulting in unsatisfactory player operations and inability to meet player needs. The VR game operation is not coordinated with the device, which reduces the game experience. Can't really let players experience immersive somatosensory and lose the original intention of VR games.

<h2>Plans</h2>
<p>
As the project idea previously revealed. We were planned to create a VR game called "The End". This game has a similar theme to "Red Dead Redemption" which is an open world action adventure VR type game. 
It is a game for the player enters the adventure story of the western wilderness. The player does not need to use the mouse and keyboard to operate the game. Instead, they use virtual reality technology to
 bring players into this virtual world. The game will bring real vision and hearing to players. Such as riding a horse, gliding wings, and being able to interact freely with things in space. Here, players 
around the world will be on the same server. To achieve this, there are many steps that is required.
<br>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xfQD3x5/c.jpg" alt="c" border="0"></a>
<br>

The first step is to learn about the foundation of building a game, we need to have some skills in graphic design software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and CorelDRAW. Also, Pixel art such as
 3dxmax, Pixlr and GrafX2 used to make character models and architectural images that focus on game programming foundation and game production principles. (https://kaoshi.china.com/vr_px_31740-1.htm) Because
 it is necessary to understand the principles of game design, as well as software foundation and rendering. To achieve this step, the action we will be taking is to begin to take basic public lesson, this 
includes learning it from various websites such as Youtube, Bilibili about the functions the graphic design software has and game planning, production, testing and operation practices, as well as game 
industry planning and professional quality. Also, participating in online classes or reading articles are great choices as well. These steps of the plan can lay the foundation for future VR game design.
The next step is to get familiar with VR language development which is the language of the 3D programming engine. VR cannot be developed without 3D engine support. Therefore, plans of learning Unity/ 
3Dx Max modelling is a must. How do we plan to learn it? The first step is to first understand the menu and view interface of unity3d. These are the most basic foundations and can be operated like a word.
<br>

 The second step is to understand the coordinate system, input system, and simple vector concepts in the scene. 
<br>

The third step is to learn some basic concepts of creating basic scenes: game objects, components, and scripts.
<br>
<a href="https://ibb.co/H2wTxLk"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/n0dMnq5/image.jpg" alt="image" border="0"></a>
<br>

 The fourth step is to learn some basic elements of resource import: mesh, material, texture, animation, etc. The sixth step is to further study the camera, lighting, terrain, rendering, particle system, physics system, etc.
 (https://baike.baidu.com/item/Unity3D/3064002?fr=aladdin) Unity3D is a multi-platform comprehensive game development tool developed by Unity Technologies that allows players to easily create interactive content such as 3D video games,
 architectural visualizations, real-time 3D animations, etc. It is a fully integrated professional game engine. (http://www.eepw.com.cn/article/201608/295413.htm) By learning the basics of Unity3D program development, we can be skilled in 3D game
 development technology combat, game engine modification and use of network communication, database and game server. (https://wenku.baidu.com/view/546234e4f4335a8102d276a20029bd64783e629e.html) We will also be using Unreal engine, which is a game 
engine developed by Epic Games because it is easier for us as the entry barrier will be lower. To achieve this step, the action we will be taking is to take lessons online or participate in practical training from schools. Therefore,  another major plan
 for us is to use the correct game engine for this virtual reality game as choosing the right game engine can better handle the communication between the player and the computer, and handle signals from other controllers. 
As we planned to use Unity/ 3Dmax engine for our VR game called "The End". We will be proficient in various programming languages. Game program development mainly includes general C++, C# skills. But for this one, we need to know some C# programming 
language It is because Unity requires a certain programming foundation to use. C# programming language is a safe, stable, simple, and elegant object-oriented programming language derived from C and C++. (https://baike.baidu.com/item/c%23/195147?fr=aladdin) 
Therefore, it is necessary to learn. But we are not learning from scratch, because there is a little Java language foundation, I believe we will learn faster. Learning C# is like how we are currently learning Java. We can get resources from online. Knowing
 codes by reading C# language programming books. Also, watching video tutorials online is an option as well.
<br>
<a href="https://ibb.co/Tq8Kfww"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/2Yt89FF/meigong.png" alt="meigong" border="0"></a>
<br>

For creating the scene and how the virtual world react to the players in the game "The End". In more detail, the scene will be made up by simple solids piled up like Lego to form a striking scene. The virtual world is made up of thousands of individual 
objects, which are then moved to Autodesk's 3ds Max to process the calculate how they will be lit so that they can pop up when added to the completed project. Also, for our game, we will bring all the components built in the block into Epic Games' Unreal 
Engine, using blueprints to add logic and interaction so that this virtual world can react to players behaviour. For non-professional producers, the blueprint allows them to skip the difficult process of learning programming languages to encode and directly
 edit the logic and interactivity of the virtual world response through simple and convenient methods. Thanks to the use of the game engine, without the help of these two engines in some steps, it will take longer to complete "The End"
 (https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1584742024630913326&wfr=spider&for=pc) 
<br>
<a href="https://ibb.co/Csp321t"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/yBmcSfR/image.png" alt="image" border="0"></a>
<br>
The final step will be the use of the Peripherals and the controllers, which is the preparation of Cooperation between the operation of VR games and VR hardware. Having VR hardware is very important because it increases the user experience by giving
 them more immersion and interaction. VR glasses are the most basic peripherals. The VR handle is also necessary, it can be used to control the movement of characters and make actions. The integrated head-mounted display device has an independent processor 
and has its own independent computing power. It is more convenient to use. There is no need to prepare additional equipment, the degree of freedom is relatively high, and the price Also cantered, generally around 600-1000 dollars. External head-mounted 
display device This is the most technical product in the VR industry. The product is more complex and requires a computer to be connected via a data cable. The price is relatively high, basically around 2000 dollars 
(https://www.zhihu.com/question/35942279). Therefore this one is not considered. Now, many VR games (including "The End") all support the room tracking mode, players can move freely within a certain range, but there are also many players who are in
 a small space, it is difficult to obtain a better game experience, (https://www.huahuo.com/vr/201910/36436.html) therefore, it is needed for our VR game. Here comes the problem, these peripherals are not cheap. For this project, we will probably
 rent them because this is the most cost-effective way.

<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>
After all the plans are confirmed. It's time to take action. For our team, we all entered RMIT as freshmen in computer science / information technology or computer research.
<br>
First of all, we already have a certain knowledge of programming languages. Since Unity is a mobile platform application development supporting java, C / C ++ languages, and java, C / C ++ are very good programming languages.
 They can develop games for any given system. Of the few game programming languages, VR's requirements for software development are in-depth, so mastering programming languages is very basic. We are also learning more about programming languages to
 help us complete the "end" of VR games.
(https://games.qq.com/a/20170323/023686.htm?qqcom_pgv_from=aio)
<br>
<a href="https://ibb.co/dD3RWKX"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/kXrtHcz/Capture.png" alt="Capture" border="0"></a>
<br>
Second, of course, consider lighting and rendering the scene. Due to the special nature of VR game production, we need a total of two fisheye lenses to complete the recording and collection. This requires two rendering processes. In this process, you need 
to pay attention to the ambient light. The problem is that the light of most programs is unreal and is very different from the natural environment. Ambient light is widely distributed and can enter the scene by reflecting and refracting objects; ambient light
 can also illuminate areas that cannot be illuminated by other light sources. The intensity of the ambient light in different areas is also different, and the coloring angle is also different.
<br>
At present, we have begun to make models of certain characters and environments in the game. The production of game characters will enrich the details of the model through color maps, highlight maps, normal maps, self-illumination maps and other texture
 types,
 distinguish the textures of different objects and finally use the engine.
<br>
We sketched the world view of the game. In the game, almost every element is part of the world view. For example, the time, weather, and season set by the game. Using realistic and modern western style, the background data set in the game including economy, 
culture, religion, game world and character shape design, and game music, etc. all constitute elements of the game world. Establishing this rule is not easy. There are many places to discuss. The complex worldview structure has been changed over and over again 
to satisfy the players ’interests. Some values depend on common sense to reach the real rules, and we really did not do it at this point. Well, we tend to ignore some habitual rules, so we decided to construct a fixed world background template and build natural
 and human settings. For example, the existence of natural materials and humanities

(http://www.woocg.com/group/6/thread/3)
<br>
We use different methods to complete special effects. Create special effects with 2D maps that are relatively primitive, technically mature, and take up less internal resources. Create one or more black and white effects in Photoshop to form a black and 
white sequence image. The black and white sequence image is the channel information of the special effect, and then the program assigns the corresponding color to the special effect channel and controls the rotation, scaling, and reduction. This can make
 the
 picture have a variety of color appearance, thereby saving resources and changing effects. In 3D games, it is easier to create special effects in this way than in 2D games. Because all you need to do now is a photo, and the rest of the rotation and zoom 
can be achieved by the program. This method greatly saves art time and has a better effect. The simple game effect image created in Photoshop is black and white, the white part is the part that generates glow, the gray part is translucent, and the black part 
is completely transparent and does not generate glow. In the game, through the program to adjust the color of the picture, control the size or rotation of special effects, as long as you change the basic attributes, you can get a lot of beautiful effects. At 
the same time, the special effects of the 3D game cannot be completely represented by 2D pictures. The effects observed in every angle in the game scene are actually 3d special effects. It is not difficult to make such special effects. The first step is to create
 a basic using 3dsmax and other 3d software under very detailed conditions. The face model, then progressively provide the glow map to the extended model, and use 3dsmax to rotate, fill, expand and contract the model. In this way, a special 3d effect can be
 achieved. At the same time, almost all 3D games will use an excellent particle system, of which the more powerful system is Maya. 3dsmax started in 6.0 and added a new "particle flow" tool, which qualitatively improved the function of the Max particle system. 
It has different functions in the process of creating particle animations through Particle Flow. In order to make 3dsmax particle animation more and more powerful, for game production, due to the limitations of computer hardware, complex particle system is not the 
first choice, the basic particle system is completely enough. The particle system is written by the game engine, and the parameters of the entire system do not change much. If you use the particle system, two-dimensional pictures and three-dimensional modelling
, they can complete special effects such as snow, waterfalls, and flames.

<br>
The final game test is very important. When there is a problem with the game screen, we should first check whether it is an external cause such as bad network, bad hardware, system problems, etc. At the same time, the Unity debugger can detect the code at runtime.
 Unity uses MonoDevelop IDE to debug scripts in the game. It can debug all languages supported by the engine (JavaScript, C / C ++, etc.). The sound test is also important. The sound in VR moves with the angle of view, and the accuracy of sound positioning is
 very high. The importance of sound is no less than the picture. The high-performance sound card can parse the audio very well, which is convenient for sound judgment and positioning.

<h2>Roles</h2>

In the game development process, there will be many roles participating in the development and creation of the game, such as Lead Developer, or Technical Designer, or User Interface Designer. Game development is not similar to other software development, players need to experience the fun of the game, need to get experience from the game to complete what the user wants to get through the game, and the game creative director is such a role. His job is to organize and lead the team to complete the concept of the game, including characters, scripts, plots and so on. In the development process, the development direction of the game project was determined, and the final decision on the design differences was also made. Being confident, sticking to your own ideas, and having the ability to do it are all necessary for a good game creative director. Similarly, the game technical director is also an indispensable part of this process. His main responsibility is to complete the maintenance of game products and Develop and solve core problems, routine maintenance, system upgrade, and error repair. It plays a role in the progress of the entire project, task allocation, and task deployment. It has the ability of program developers in the development team to reach the overall strength of the project.

<h2>Scopes and limits</h2>
<p>In this game, the story and graphics will not be priorities, the main feature that will be focused on is the player's interaction with in-game environment and making them as realistic as possible. Players will start with learning about 
the features of the game instead of relying on in-game instructions and gradually realizing some hint about the storyline, the misterious of the world in this game then inspiring them to learn more about this world. The game takes the same theme of 
western cowboys like "Red death redemption" and in which, the player plays the role of a sheriff in a town and serves to protect the peace of the town. Initially, player may not need to care about the story, they will have time to learn about the activities 
in the game such as throwing stones, bottles, shooting, riding horse, finding a piano to play a chord, find a knife to cut fruit, or they might get drunk from drinking too much alcohol. Interaction with NPCs will also be emphasized because it will enhance the 
experience of players in the game. NPCs will react when subjected to physical effects from players such as being shot or hit, players can also hold the NPC by holding the wrist or leg. Because of such complex interactions, the game's graphics as well as the plot
 can not be elaborated in the early stages of the game, the map in the game is not too large, limited to only three small towns.</p>


<HR style="border:3 dotted #2F4F4F" width= "100%" SIZE=3>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>
In order to realize the development of VR games, C ++, C # and JS are necessary software for programming. UE4 is suitable for scene construction, Substance Painter is suitable for textures, Maya and 3D Max are very good modeling software. During the
 entire VR game production process, Substance Painter, Maya, 3D Max, UE 4, and other professional software used by the development team are very hardware intensive. In order to ensure quality and efficiency, and to solve the unique difficulties of VR 
game development, the development of "End" is also Requires a computer with powerful overall performance. Especially in the processing of specific links such as textures, models, and light rendering, there are also editing levels, browsing levels, and 
even some level effects, and the VR headset used for "End" hardware selection is HTC Vive, with a resolution of 2160x1200. Therefore, in terms of computer hardware, we selected the CPU to be I7-7700, 32GB graphics card, and dual-channel Titan Z to achieve
 a comfortable and smooth production and testing experience, and provide guarantee for the testing of VR hardware.
</p>


<HR style="border:3 dotted #2F4F4F" width= "100%" SIZE=3>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>testing program is not only to verified that it works, it is to find out that the program works as we expected it to be and doesn’t perform unintended consequences. Thus, it is crucial to think about how to test the program throughout the
 process of creating it. It is even more important for our team to test the game when there is no one in our group actually have the experience to create the game before. Acknowledged that, our team did a few study and come up with some idea of how 
to do the testing.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1114542/Testing-for-Game-Development">Testing for game development</a>, there are 5 attributes of a well tested software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complesness: the code should do every thing it need to do.</li>
<li>Correctness: the code work without error.</li>
<li>Performance and Resource Usage: the code have acceptable performance and resource usage.</li>
<li>Reliability/Stability: the code work reliably and can handle unexpected events.</li>
<li>Fun(for game development): do all that and the game still fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these 5 attribute, we can create a checklist to check every feature, every function of the game. Now that we have what to expect from the result, there should be steps and instruction to evaluate these attributes of our game. Regarding to this,
 several test method can be take into account:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.testbytes.net/blog/functional-testing-7-best-practices/">Functionality Testing<a>(correctness, reliability): this test will determines if the application is working according to specification so it will take time using this method 
as we looking for gameplay issues, graphic issues, audio-visual issues,... Our idea in the game is interaction with the gamer so these function can not be ignored because it may gradually diminish player’s experience. This function test can be done within 
our group because these function error is not hard to realize. So we can test the feature of the game after each interaction with the environment if it work as it should or is it the right sound after complete an action.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing">Regression Testing</a>: this mean our group will retest the unchanged part we did throughout the project because as chaotic as software development will be, new changes may introduce new errors
 or vulnerabilities to the previous function that already function well. Our team will conduct this test every time a newly function or feature is created.</li>
<li>Beta test: it mean creating the early access product before release the game officially on the play store. This is a very useful method since we can receive the feedback from user about bugs and errors that still exist in the game, or some idea about how 
to improve. Although, it hard to meet up everyone expectation, and it’s awful when receive negative attitude from player, but with these being fix our team can go much further with the game.
<a href="https://www.testbirds.com/use-cases/test-objects/testing-games-vr-ar/">This website</a> is also useful for this type of method.</li>
<li><a href="https://schoolofgamedesign.com/project/play-test-game-design/">Play test</a>(completeness, fun): this method is similar to beta test but we can observed from a closer distance. The tester can see how the player interact with the game,
 what expression the player make and make some conclusion about what to improve.</li>
</ol>


<HR style="border:3 dotted #2F4F4F" width= "100%" SIZE=3>

<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>The amount of software that we need to master before create the VR game might be overwhelming in such a short amount of time given, especially when all the member in the group are still freshman in this industry. Thank to the course we took in RMIT
 about java programing language, it is easier to learn about the advance of this language. But to learn the basics of graphic design tool such as adobe photoshop may take only a few day but it may take months to be familiar with the tools and be able 
to create a good screen without error or bugs. The same situation may happen when we learn 3dxmax tool to create character model and 3D programing engine such as Unity3D. Thus, with only a few member of our group, we can not guarantee that we can develop
 "The end" with a shortage of time. Dealing with this situation, getting help from the outside is an option. This can be done by make friend with other people around that might be interested in our idea and want to join in the process. This might somewhat
 reduce the learning and master these tool time.</p>

<p>There is also a risk that our idea in the project may not be enough to complete with other competitor on the market. There are already a volume of VR game on the market. Most of them are created by professional with lots of experience in this industry.
 Therefore, with us freshman carrying out the first project in such field, failure is almost inevitable. But this will be a good opportunity to learn from this and improve next time.</p>


<HR style="border:3 dotted #2F4F4F" width= "100%" SIZE=3>

<h2>Group processes and communications</h2>
<p>Our group had already learned a lesson in the last assignment,
this time we avoided repeating the same mistakes. When encountering unrecorded records,
it may be messenger's message, we will choose to take a screenshot. The following is our screenshot.
Mostly were reminding teammates. We meet once a week, and sometimes assigning tasks via sending posts on
Microsoft Team the rest of the time. If the group members do not reply, we will choose to remind them to
reply in general channel or private channel on Teams or use messenger.</p>
