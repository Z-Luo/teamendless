<p>In the past few years, virtual reality technology has brought us large amount of display and input devices.
 VR is used to create three-dimensional environments that can replace the real world. Imagine you are sitting on a 
chair and looking down. You see your body, from your arms to your lap, and your legs. But it is not your body, it is a
 virtual body created by Mel Slater, a professor of virtual environment at the University of Barcelona, is inside his lab
 and it is what VR are capable of. A virtual reality system consisting of hardware and software. System software includes virtual reality
 software programmed in various program languages to model and simulate objects. Hardware are Input devices which enhance the ability to stimulate users' 
senses to simulate virtual reality, such as stereophonic headsets, G-sensor location sensors, Bluetooth controls,... and output devices include display screen,
 impulse,... The salient feature of VR is to create virtual things, virtual environments. Thereby, it help to recreate the object that are available, 
or display the things that are expected to produce. Then, analyzing and making decisions will be more intuitive, more accurate, and save a lot of time. 
Having a virtual environment also means that people can meet, work and exchange directly anywhere in the world without actually get there. The creation 
of a virtual environment also supports easy remote control, creating more possibilities for production. When more possibilities can be reached, it is obvious
 that the opportunity for further development will be endless. By creating a deeper and more personal connection with the player, VR has a great potential of
 attracting gamer around the world, and has become what they are dream of these days.</p>

<br>
<p>Even though possibilities are endless, VR is still relatively new, so are the products is still yet to be prefect. In fact, virtual reality existed
 before the 2010s, but starting in 2020 was a period of tremendous growth. Reported from
 <a href ="https://www.forbes.com/sites/solrogers/2019/11/08/the-vr-companies-shaking-up-location-based-entertainment/#220b47ff14c5" >Fobes</a>,
 it's predicted that location-based entertainment will contain approximately 11 per cent of the VR industry by 2023. location-based entertainment(LBE) 
is a term used for a form of entertainment such as a game in which the gameplay evolves and progresses via user's location. Therefore, these activity will
 provide user with some localization technology that can report  their location such as VR headset. The VOID is well known in this market with various 
franchise it's linked to such as Star Wars, Wreck It Ralph, Ghostbusters and Avenger and with 16 opened location around the world. One of the VOID feature
 is that it combine VR and real-world sets, allow people to interact with real environment and object.</p>
<p>In this era of ever-growing technology, with the appear of AR and VR, developers look forward to giving users more realistic experiences in the virtual 
world by combining them in the future.<a href ="https://thebossmagazine.com/future-virtual-reality/"> Michael Abrash, the Oculus chief scientists who made this 
prediction states the challenges of reconstructing the real world, and states that augmented VR will be an integral part of virtual reality.</a> Virtual reality
 glasses are now relatively large in size and have quite a lot of details while different brands try to make them look more polished each year. As technology
 becomes more advanced, devices are known to become more compact and more delicacy in design. The same thing happens with VR headsets, by 2025 they might be
 the style of sunglasses. This requires a huge reduction in the size of these virtual reality glasses and as a result will allow the user to use technology
 smoothly, especially for those who are not comfortable wearing bulky virtual reality glasses.</p>

<p>Project Description Likely Impact</p>
<p> Virtual Reality is a concept that has been around for many years, but only recently as technology is being
build to handle the stressful task of virtual reality can we start experiencing it. Have you ever seen someone
wearing a VR Headset and screaming because they are going through a simulation of a roller coaster, already
virtual reality has become so realistic but only reached 2 of the 5 senses humans have, sight and hearing are
the two senses that are the pillars of VR, with advancements of multi-dimensional audio virtual reality is
becoming indifferentiable from reality, senses like touch, smell and taste are already in the works and once we
have those we might not be able the tell the difference between reality and virtual reality anymore. With a
truly realistic virtual experience you could spend time with a distant loved one with ease from the comfort of
your own homes. I believe the younger generation will be the ones most impacted by virtual reality as it shows
that they are currently the intended users so anyone under the age of 30 as they are the ones who do the most
travel and this could all be replaced by virtual reality. With the further developments of virtual reality, we
might see a decrease in travel, and this might make airport or pilot jobs redundant as we are already moving
towards driverless transport. Seeing the world in person would eventually be the same as seeing it in virtual
reality so world travel would also decrease. There are also negatives to VR as already we see vision degradation
problems and seizures as a negative outcome of the technology, and an addiction to escape the real world is also
a very likely possibility as it already has with social media but we could be harming our bodies being trapped in
the VR emulation for multiple hours a day.</p>

<p> Project Description How Will This Effect You</p>
<p>In My Family, VR would provide a positive outcome as both my parents work in businesses and take frequent trips
interstate and sometimes even overseas for weeks to months to go and attend business meeting across the world. The
introduction of VR might eliminate that and allow my mother and father to stay close to home and be with my little
sister instead of going away for so long. In my daily life this might affect me because I love video games and I am
very drawn to this new technology of VR especially after watching movies such as Ready Player One, It might act as
a new form of entertainment for me and I would be able to see my friends who live far away from me even during
periods of lockdown like we are going through now and it will be just like meeting them in real life. Although I 
already require glasses to see clearly so extended periods of VR might be too strenuous on my eyes and possibly cause
my vision to get worse and I can easy fall victim to this as I already to spend most of my days in front of a screen.</p>

<h1>Project idea: VR game</h1>

<h2>Group interest </h2>
<p>video game, vr technology, mobile application: Because of these interest in IT, so our first idea is a immersive mobile VR game since some 
of our group member have mobile application developer as the ideal job, so that this project may help us to be more familiar with the mobile game market and
 we can improve our skill on developing mobile application such as java. But we realize that developing a VR game on mobile phone have some limitation. First,
 not all smart phone integrated virtual reality software, only a few of them because smartphones are geared toward compactness and convenience, system hardware
 is unlikely to meet the demands of VR gaming that need a chip powerful enough to run. </p>
