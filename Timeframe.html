<th>week 9</th>
<th>For this week, althrough we have not started on the assignment 3 yet.  
Currently we are learning to build the foundation of this game, that is programming.
It is now the end of the semester, after learning the introduction to programming,
 we already have a certain understanding of the programming language. Therefore, Zizhen, 
Sihan, Trung and Rithvik is doing our own learning.</th>

<tr>
<th>week 10</th>
<th>For week 10. We started meeting our group members for Assignment 3 because 
last time during Assignment 2, we were having a trouble with forming groups and ended
up really rush. Therefore we made plans for this one that is to set goals for everyone
of us at the beginning stage. tasks for Zizhen and Sihan are to complete Tools,Detailed
 Description which includes Aims, Plans and Progress, Roles, Tools and Technologies,
 Timeframe. Trung and Rithvik's tasks are Project Description which includes project
 ideas, Overview, Scope and limits, testing and risks.</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>week 11</th>
<th>For this week, we have more communications and talking to each others via Microsoft
 Teams. After Aim, Plans and Progress are finished, we started to look into C and C++
 which is the programming language required for Unity 3D software and finding the 
 similarities between these languages. For assignment 3 report, Sihan and Zizhen have
done Detailed description, Trung and Rithvik have done project description. </th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>week 12</th>
<th>For week 12, all of our group members met via Microsoft Teams again which improves communication.
At present, we have begun to make models of certain characters and environments in the
 game. The production of game characters will enrich the details of the model through
 color maps, highlight maps, normal maps, self-illumination maps and other texture
 types, distinguish the textures of different objects and finally use the engine. Also 
Sihan have started sketching the world view. For assignment 3 report, Sihan and Zizhen have
done Aims, Plans and Progress, Roles, Tools and Technologies,
 Timeframe., Trung and Rithvik have done project
 ideas, Overview, Scope and limits, testing and risks. The rest of the parts was done
 by all members of our team, great effort.</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>week 13</th>
<th>For week 13, We will be continue to sketch the world view of the game.
 In the game, almost every element is part of the world view. For example,
 the time, weather, and season set by the game. Using realistic and modern
 western style, the background data set in the game including economy, culture,
 religion, game world and character shape design, and game music, etc. all constitute
 elements of the game world. </th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>week 14</th>
<th>For week 14,we will learn basic Photoshop skills and start to create one or
 more black and white effects in Photoshop to form a black and white sequence
 image. This is because The black and white sequence image is the channel
 information of the special effect, and then the program assigns the corresponding
 color to the special effect channel and controls the rotation, scaling, and
 reduction. This can make the picture have a variety of color appearance, 
thereby saving resources and changing effects.</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>week 15</th>
<th>For this week, we are about to creat black and white sequence image in 3D 
instead of the 2D we have created for in week 14. It is easier for us to creat it
, because all you need to do now is a photo, and the rest of the rotation
 and zoom can be achieved by the program.</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>week 16</th>
<th>It is the time for us to use the software 3ds Max to build the map.
 The first step for us is to create a basic using 3dsmax and other 3d software under
 very detailed conditions. The face model, then progressively provide the glow
 map to the extended model, and use 3dsmax to rotate, fill, expand and contract
 the model. </th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>week 17</th>
<th>In order to make 3dsmax particle animation more and more powerful,
 for game production, due to the limitations of computer hardware, complex
 particle system is not the first choice, the basic particle system is completely 
enough. Therefore, Working on the program Maya, which is a more powerful system 
for us to use. We will be learning it while using it for this week.</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>week 18</th>
<th>For week 18, our group member will continue to work on the 3ds Max and Maya 
program, by using them, we will be completing special effects such as snow,
 waterfalls, and flames. This will meet the scene requirement that we have previously
 set for this project.</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>week 19</th>
<th>After we have completed our game program "The End", it is time for us to test 
the game and see if it works. The final game test is very important. When there 
is a problem with the game screen, we will check whether it is an external cause 
such as bad network, bad hardware, system problems, etc. At the same time, the Unity 
debugger can detect the code at runtime. Unity uses MonoDevelop IDE to debug scripts
 in the game. we will learn the bugs that it had debuged and won't make the same
 mistake next time.</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>week 20</th>
<th>For week 20 we will be finding the bugs from sound test. We will do the sound
 test because it is also important. The sound in VR moves with the angle of view,
 and the accuracy of sound positioning is very high. The importance of sound is no
 less than the picture. The high-performance sound card can parse the audio very
 well, which is convenient for sound judgment and positioning.</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>week 21</th>
<th>For Week 21, after we finished fingding errors of the game. it is time for us
 to make our VR game "The End" work. Zizhen and Sihan will take care of the materials
 and Trung and Rithvik will take care of the testing hardware process. when we are 
finding the VR glasses and handles, we will be renting them instead of buying them 
because our budget is not enough. </th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>week 22</th>
<th>The final week for us to do is to find some friends or our tutor to test it 
our and having them to tell us what they feel and listening to their suggestions. 
Then we could celebrate our achievements we have done!</th>
